Here’s a clean, fun, blog-style answer you can submit.
I’ve written **two separate cases**, each with: *what’s happening, what’s wrong, and one improvement idea*, wrapped in a detective-vibes blog style.

# 🔍 **Case 1: The Hiring Bot Mystery**

*By: The Responsible AI Inspector*

When I arrived at the digital crime scene, the Hiring Bot was working overtime — scanning CVs, ranking candidates, and quietly deciding who gets an interview. On paper, it sounded efficient. In practice? Something shady was unfolding.

### 🕵️‍♂️ **What’s happening**

The company uses an AI model to screen job applicants. It reviews CVs, looks for “strong” career patterns, and automatically rejects anyone who doesn’t match past successful candidates.

### 🚨 **What’s problematic**

The bot seems to reject more **female applicants with career gaps**, especially those caused by maternity leave. That’s a big red flag.
Why?

* It’s **replicating historical bias** from older data where men with continuous careers were dominant.
* There’s **no transparency**, so applicants have no idea why they were rejected.
* Responsibility is fuzzy: who’s accountable — the bot or the company?

This combo makes the system unfair and discriminatory.

### 🛠️ **One improvement idea**

Build fairness into the system:
➡️ **Use bias-auditing and rebalanced training data**, especially adjusting for career gaps so they aren’t treated as “negative.”
Add transparency: short explanations for decisions.

Case solved… for now.

# 🔍 **Case 2: The Over-Eager School Proctor AI**

*By: The Responsible AI Inspector*

The next case brought me to a virtual exam room. Students hunched over laptops, while an AI proctor “watched” them like a hawk. Too much like a hawk.

### 🕵️‍♂️ **What’s happening**

The school uses an AI system to monitor exam-takers, tracking eye movement, facial direction, and head position. If a student looks around too much, the AI marks them as “suspicious.”

### 🚨 **What’s problematic**

Some students — especially **neurodivergent learners** or those with anxiety, tics, or ADHD — naturally move their eyes or head more. The AI doesn’t understand that.
So it ends up:

* **Flagging the wrong students**, leading to unfair accusations.
* Creating **privacy concerns** because it collects high-sensitivity biometric data.
* Offering **no clear appeals process**, turning the AI into judge, jury, and examiner.

### 🛠️ **One improvement idea**

Make the AI a helper, not a judge:
➡️ **Use the AI only as a support tool**, with all flags reviewed by a human before any accusation.
Also retrain the model on diverse movement patterns so it understands normal variations.

If you'd like, I can format it more academically, add citations, shorten it to 150 words per case, or rewrite it in a different style.
