*A mini-blog investigation into two AI cases*

Welcome to my digital detective log. In this report, I investigate how AI systems behave in real-world scenarios, uncover what can go wrong, and suggest simple but powerful fixes to make them more responsible.

## 🔍 **Case 1: The Hiring Bot Mystery**

### **What’s Happening**

A company uses an AI hiring tool to screen job applicants. It analyzes CVs and automatically rejects candidates who don’t match “successful” historical profiles.

### **What’s Problematic**

The bot rejects more **female applicants with career gaps**, repeating old patterns of workplace bias.
Key issues:

* **Bias transfer** from historical hiring data
* **Lack of transparency** in rejections
* **Unclear accountability** for unfair outcomes

### **Improvement Idea**

Introduce **bias auditing and balanced training data**, especially regarding career gaps. Provide clear decision explanations to applicants.

## 🔍 **Case 2: The Over-Eager School Proctor AI**

### **What’s Happening**

A school uses an AI proctor to monitor students during exams by tracking eye and head movements.

### **What’s Problematic**

The system often flags **neurodivergent students** who naturally move more, leading to unfair suspicion.
Concerns include:

* **False accusations**
* **Biometric privacy risks**
* **No human review** of flagged cases

If you'd like, I can generate this as a downloadable **README.md file**, format it differently, or add emojis/images.
